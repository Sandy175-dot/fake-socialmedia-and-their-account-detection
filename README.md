# Fake Social Media and Account Detection

A machine learning project aimed at detecting **fake social media accounts** and analyzing suspicious user activity patterns across platforms. This tool can help identify bots, spammers, or fraudulent profiles by leveraging **data analysis, machine learning models, and classification techniques**.

---

## Features

- Detects **fake or suspicious accounts** based on behavior, activity, and metadata.  
- Uses **machine learning algorithms** (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) for classification.  
- Data preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and feature extraction.  
- Visualization of results (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.).  
- Scalable and easy to integrate into real-world systems.

## 🧪 Features & Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**  
   Load datasets of social media account profiles—structured CSV or JSON—and handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Derive features such as:
   - Account age (days)
   - Follower-to-following ratio
   - Posting frequency & activity intervals
   - Username pattern analysis (numeric vs alphabetic ratio)
   - Bio description length & repetition metrics

3. **Model Training**  
   Train a classifier (e.g. Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost), perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g. via grid search), and validate using k‑fold cross-validation.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   Evaluate model using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC‑AUC, and Confusion Matrix.

5. **Prediction Module**  
   Load a saved model to predict account authenticity on new input data.
